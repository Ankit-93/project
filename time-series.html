                <h2></h2>

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Accurate electricity demand forecasts are crucial for electric utilities and regional
                    transmission organizations. Long-term forecasts reduce investment risk, medium-term
                    forecasts aid in planning fuel purchases and scheduling plant maintenance, and short-term
                    forecasts are essential for matching electricity generation with demand to ensure grid
                    reliability.</p>
                <p>This project focused on medium-term forecasting, specifically making one-week-out forecasts
                    at an hourly resolution for London. Historical electricity demand and weather data from
                    2002-2020 were used. A combination of time series analysis and regression models were
                    employed to make forecasting predictions, which were compared against the observed hourly
                    electricity demand for a series of one-week intervals.</p>

                <h3>Data Collection</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Electricity Demand Data:</strong> Historical electricity demand data was
                        provided by the County of London Electric Supply Company (C.L.E.S.Co) Limited. The data
                        for each year was segmented by weather zones. Initial processing included converting
                        timestamps to datetime indexes, removing duplicate entries by averaging values with the
                        same timestamp, and filling missing values by backfilling from the next available entry.
                        This resulted in a dataframe of time and load.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weather Data:</strong> Weather features like temperature and humidity impact
                        electricity consumption. Weather data was sourced from Weather Underground. A parser was
                        built to extract relevant data from a single API endpoint, and the data scraping script
                        was extended to compile hourly weather data from 2002-2020 into a single dataframe. The
                        data included time, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. Missing
                        wind speed data was converted to the mean or lowest observed wind speed, weather
                        conditions were converted to integers, and humidity values were converted to
                        percentages. Hourly frequency of the data was enforced by removing duplicate entries.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Feature Engineering</h3>
                <p>The categorical feature "condition" was converted into a one-hot encoding. The original
                    dataset from Weather Underground used 17 different weather conditions, which were grouped
                    into 6 broad categories: clear, cloud, rain, tstorm, fog, and snow. The electricity demand
                    and weather data were merged into a single dataframe, with missing values filled in by
                    back-filling for one-hot encoding features and interpolation for continuous features.</p>
                <p>Additional temporal features were created, such as a boolean feature "weekday" to indicate
                    whether it was a weekday, and sine/cosine transformations for the hour of the day to capture
                    time-of-day effects. Continuous features were normalized to the range [0, 1] to facilitate
                    model training.</p>

                <h3>Designing Models</h3>
                <p>Time series forecasting becomes more challenging as the forecasting period decreases.
                    Therefore, the original electricity demand time series was decomposed into two components:
                    monthly average electricity demand and hourly residuals. The monthly averages were modeled
                    using traditional time series methods, while the hourly residuals (the amount above or below
                    the monthly average at each hour) were modeled using various regression models. The
                    predictions from both models were combined to get a full prediction for hourly electricity
                    demand.</p>

                <h3>Summary: Electricity Demand Forecasting Models</h3>
                <h4>Monthly Averages (SARIMA)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Model:</strong> SARIMA (seasonal ARIMA) captures yearly seasonality (m=12) and
                        trends in monthly demand.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Split:</strong> Sequential training (2002–2014), validation (2015–2016),
                        test (2017–2020) sets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tuning:</strong> Grid search for hyperparameters (values 0/1) using MAE (to
                        avoid issues with normalized MAPE).</li>
                    <li><strong>Insights:</strong> Clear upward trend (population growth) and seasonality
                        (summer peaks, smaller winter spikes). Winter peaks correlate with holidays/cold
                        weather.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Hourly Residuals (Regression)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Residuals (actual – monthly average) modeled via regression
                        for 1-week-ahead hourly forecasts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Baseline:</strong> Persistence model (last week’s value as forecast).</li>
                    <li><strong>Models Tested:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Linear Regression: Outperformed baseline but lacked nuance (overweighted
                                time-of-day features).</li>
                            <li>Gradient Boosting (GBR): Best performance (61% MAPE improvement), captured daily
                                peaks.</li>
                            <li>MLP: Better than linear regression but lagged GBR due to hyperparameter tuning
                                challenges.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Validation:</strong> Weekly forecasts concatenated to avoid error snowballing.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>SARIMA + GBR combo delivered optimal accuracy.</li>
                    <li>Future Improvements: Deeper hyperparameter tuning (especially MLP), adding contextual
                        features (e.g., events).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Evaluating Final Models</h3>
                <p>The predictions from both the monthly and hourly models were combined and evaluated against
                    the test data. The MAPE was computed for each model. All three models performed better than
                    the baseline, with GBR performing best, followed by MLP, and linear regression significantly
                    worse. Visualizations of one-week-out forecasts for each model over a span of two weeks on
                    the test set showed GBR with the best performance, followed by MLP and linear regression.
                </p>

                <h3>Summary & Future Work</h3>
                <p>This project addressed the issue of forecasting electricity demand at one-week intervals with
                    an hourly resolution. The original time series data was decomposed into monthly averages and
                    hourly residuals. The monthly averages were modeled using a SARIMA model, and the hourly
                    residuals were modeled using three different regression models. Gradient boosting regression
                    showed the best performance on the test set, with a 61% improvement over the baseline
                    persistence model.</p>
                <p>The accuracy of the gradient boosting regression model is quite good and could be used for
                    one-week-out forecasting as a first-order estimate. For higher accuracy, further study is
                    suggested, including a more thorough investigation of hyperparameters and adding contextual
                    features to improve model accuracy.</p>
